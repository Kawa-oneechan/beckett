## Big list of ideas

* Mod support (Kawa)
	* Obvious.
* Play as an animal (Kawa, katzeregi, beargirlstink, mezzofurrte, probablynothing)
	* Very popular, especially playing as a cat.
	* May cause difficulties involving clothing.
	* [Tumblr post here](https://www.tumblr.com/kawaoneechan/746398728689172480).
* Romance options (Kawa)
	* And I do mean *romance*. Check your Ankha memes at the door.
* More animal types (katzeregi)
* Train sets (lustrous-orb)
	* Individual track pieces to place free-form, *Minceraft* style.
* *Way* more cats (Foone, Letrune, gryffintheparrotcat)
* Farming (bobvarioa)
	* Bob didn't know *New Horizons* introduced this.
* Mining (bobvarioa)
	* Bob didn't know *New Horizons* introduced this either.
* Swim in lakes (krusebruce, Lancette2201)
	* Let's extend this to baths, too.
* Proper jerks (ray10k)
	* Personality type, worse than Cranky.
* Ability to kill (delusionbait)
	* Denied. Even if it's a jerk.
* Advanced house building (bobvarioa, 0xb00b5, howimportantisausernameanyway)
	* Not just extending the main room size and adding north, east, west, up, and down rooms, but having each be any reasonable size and having their own further exits.
* Recycling (sweetcremereblogs)
	* Reverse DIY, reclaim component parts from objects.
	* Turn some wood into a table, take the table apart to get wood, turn it into a chair.
* More personalities (razzdrgn)
	* With only four personalities per gender, I split 'em up:
		* Boys: plain, lazy, jock, cranky, smug, spacey
		* Girls: normal, chill, peppy, snooty, big sister, weird
* More furniture (unusedcactus)
* More specific dialogue (demifiendcruithne)
	* I may have impressed Cruithne by rambling about the dialogue substitution system in *Noxico*.
	* I mean, we should totally have that system here, too.
	* [Tumblr post here](https://www.tumblr.com/kawaoneechan/767676547838672896) to publically introduce the implementation.
* Denser population areas (pontaoski)
	* *City Folk* has the town area where the regular gameplay happens, and a route to a city where the stores are.
	* That's as far as I understand it.
* No wallet cap (Kawa)
	* Let me carry around half a million bells without losing precious inventory space to the overflow!
* Content filters (yirrgzmb)
	* Not suggested by that name specifically — I think they meant that the romance options should be able to be turned off?
	* But why stop there, right? Disable jerks, disable everything but cats, disable whatever.
* Changing your name (yirrgzmb)
* Wear anything as a hat (spades-gameing)
	* Excellent idea. And if you trip or otherwise are not upright, the item can fall off as a drop.
* Streamlined inventory (justmeemawthings)
	* It depends on what you mean by "streamlined", could go many directions.
* More invertebrates (shrike-dyke)
	* Not just octopi.
* Advanced designer (mikailborg)
	* In the sense that Mikail wants to go for the normals.
* LGBTQA villagers (Letrune, shiftergirlslappy, Andrea)
* Custom map size (Kawa)
* Non-realtime option (bossbutch in a fashion, jelloapocalypse on YT)
* Choice of where to restart (Kawa)
	* When you resume the game, where do you appear? In front of your door, in your house's main room, on the last bed you used? Wherever you quit last time?
* Rideable vehicles (Lancette2201)
* Mock building parts (Lancette2201)
	* Very yes, would go well with custom-sized large maps.
* Buildings for visitors (Lancette2201)
* Online shopping (Lancette2201)
	* Via in-game laptop/desktop/whatever furniture items so you don't need Resident Services.
* Metal detector (Lancette2201)
	* To find buried stuff that doesn't get a star marker.
* Wrench tool (Kawa)
	* To bolt placed items into position so you can't accidentally pick them up while aiming for a drop.
* Sprinkler (Lancette2201)
	* To keep your crops hydrated, obviously.
* Animal tracks like in *City Folk* and *New Leaf* (several anonymous voters)
	* Optional, should have tweakable settings.
* Quicker non-blocking messages for catching creatures and breaking tools (Kawa, lizardywizard)
	* First time each event happens, use a regular dialogue. Every other time, use a Doom-ish corner message.
	* Make it a setting.

* Pet the villagers (Kawa)
	* Inspired by [this Bluesky post](https://bsky.app/profile/panken.bsky.social/post/3k3qxihdk242u) from Panken.
